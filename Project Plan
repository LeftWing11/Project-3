Project 3

Ashwin, Nick, Hardy, Jenny


Project Purpose:
The project aims to evaluate the correlation between changes in macroeconomic indicators and fluctuations in asset class prices. It addresses the need to comprehend the extent to which variations in macroeconomic factors impact diverse asset classes. 
What are the macroeconmic indicators we will look to use:
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
2. Inflation Rate
3. Unemployment Rate
4. Intrest Rates -> AUS, US
5. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure inflation
6. Currency Prices 
-> We will start with a wide range of macro variables, but through PCA we will look to identify the most important factors.  
		
What are the asset classes we will use to assess impact of marcoeconmic indicators
1. Bonds
2. Stocks
3. Property
4. Crypto Currencies
	4.1 Bitcoin 
	4.2 ETH
		
Data Sources:
1. Nick’s data source -> Still assesing whether we can get access
2. Government agencies such as ABS
3. Central Bank 
4. Kaggle 
5. Data World
6. Data.gov
7. Public APIs

 Objectives: 
	•	Identify and categorise major macroeconomic indicators affecting asset prices.
	•	Establish a quantifiable methodology to measure the impact of these indicators on asset class price changes.
	•	Analyze historical data to assess the correlation between macroeconomic indicators and asset price movements.
	•	Develop predictive models to forecast potential changes in asset prices based on macroeconomic shifts.

SWOT Analysis:
	⁃	Strengths: Access to historical data, potential for predictive modeling, interdisciplinary team collaboration.
	⁃	Weaknesses: Complexity in accurately attributing price changes, reliance on historical patterns for future predictions.
	⁃	Opportunities: Enhanced investment decision-making, potential for developing innovative predictive models.
	⁃	Threats: Unforeseen economic disruptions, limitations in accurately quantifying the impact of macroeconomic indicators on asset prices.

Project Schedule:
	•	Phase 1: Data Collection and Analysis (Today)
	•	Phase 2: Model Development (1 week)
	•	Phase 3: Testing and Validation (0.5 weeks)
	•	Phase 4: Reporting and Presentation (0.5 weeks)
